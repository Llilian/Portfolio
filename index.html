  <h2>About:</h2>
  <h3>My name is Lilian Njambi. I am 19 years old. I graduated last November from St Mary's Girls Embu.
      I decided to join Moringa because of all the amazing opportunities I have witnessed its graduates receiving.
      Having an Information Technology background in today's global market is an almost unmatched advantage when it comes to being indispensable in any company or industry.
       Finally, the course duration is only five months, which I find reasonable.
       I belive that my being here is going to be of valuable asset in my professional life moving forward.</h3>
